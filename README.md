# SmartQuarantine

SmartQuarantine is a multifaceted application designed to assist with safe movement during quarantine periods, monitor temperature for home entry, and manage online orders efficiently. 

## Overview

SmartQuarantine aims to enhance the safety and convenience of individuals during quarantine by providing tools for secure movement, health monitoring, and efficient order management.

## Features

### SMS 13033

The SMS 13033 feature allows users to generate movement requests and receive guidance on the safest routes and times for travel.

- **Design Approach:** The application uses a questionnaire model where users answer predefined questions to determine their destination, mode of transport, and time of travel.
- **Alternative Design:** An alternative approach involves a form where users input their desired time of travel and receive route suggestions and safety information.
- **Comparison:** This feature compares the user inputs against Norman's model for optimal decision-making.

### Electronic Thermometer

The Electronic Thermometer feature is designed for smart homes, enabling automated temperature checks for safe home entry.

- **Design Approach:** Users press a button on their home screen to initiate a temperature check, receiving immediate feedback and entry permissions based on their health status.
- **Alternative Design:** The alternative method involves pressing a doorbell or using a key insertion that triggers an automatic temperature check.
- **Comparison:** This feature also follows Norman's model for user-friendly interaction and safety.

### Online Order System

The Online Order System allows users to manage electronic orders efficiently, integrating with delivery and take-away services.

- **Design Approach:** Users log in to place orders, which are then processed and tracked through the application.
- **Hierarchical Analysis:** This feature includes detailed steps from logging in to completing and tracking orders.
